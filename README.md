# SQL ZOO - Microverse Project

> The purpose of this project is to consolidate the acquired knowledge of the SQL language. To do this, I carried out the evaluations proposed by the Microverse team of tutors and in the main.sql file I placed the answers to these exercises.

This web page was the first SQL language project in the Microverse curriculum.
In this project, I learned the importance of SQL statements in developing real-world solutions.

### Install

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:

- You need to [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [download as zip file](https://www.itprotoday.com/mobile-management-and-security/how-do-i-download-files-github) the repository on your device.
- [Unzip](http://www.e7z.org/open-zip.htm) the repository or just clone it using git or github.
- Grab the main_scraper.rb file and open it on your favorite online code editor, for example [repl.it.](https://replit.com/)
- If you want to see the source code of the files located in my repository, you can do it through a [code editor of your choice](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/best-code-editors), I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), first, you must [install it by following these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), then you must [open the folder containing my repository in your local repository](https://thisdavej.com/right-click-on-windows-folder-and-open-with-visual-studio-code/#:~:text=You%20can%20now%20navigate%20to,with%20VS%20Code%E2%80%9D%20as%20well.) and [open each of the files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved) to see their content.
- To run the program, you can follow the sequence of the exercises that appear on this [web portal](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics), and follow the sequence of answers to the exercises.
